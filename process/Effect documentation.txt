Basic standards:
- A target count of 0 or <0 means all
- All effects have a 'type' attribute

DRAW
- what (CardDrawType) // What kind of card should be drawn?
- amount (int) // How many cards should be drawn?
- target (EffectTarget) = self // Who should draw cards?
- targetCount (int) = 0 // How many targets should draw cards? (random, any, nearest)
- where (EffectLocation) = any // Where must those targets be? (any except self)

DISCARD
- amount (int) // How many cards should be discarded?
- target (EffectTarget) = self // Who should discard cards?
- targetCount (int) = 0 // How many targets should discard cards? (random, any, nearest)
- where (EffectLocation) = any // Where must those targets be? (any except self)

ATTACK
- target (EffectTarget) = self // Who should get an attack action?
- targetCount (int) = 0 // How many targets should get this action? (random, any, nearest)
- where (EffectLocation) = any // Where must those targets be? (any except self)

DAMAGE
- amount (int) // How much damage should be dealt?
- target (EffectTarget) = self // Who should take damage?
- where (EffectLocation) = any // Where must those targets be? (any except self)
- select (EffectSelector) = playerOrEntity // What type of targets should we select?
- targetCount (int) = 0 // How many targets should take damage? (random, any, nearest)

HEAL
- amount (int) // How much health should be given?
- target (EffectTarget) = self // Who should heal?
- where (EffectLocation) = any // Where must those targets be? (any except self)
- select (EffectSelector) = playerOrEntity // What type of targets should we select?
- targetCount (int) = 0 // How many targets should heal? (random, any, nearest)

RELOAD
- amount (int) // How much ammo should be given?
- target (EffectTarget) = self // Who should get ammo?
- where (EffectLocation) = any // Where must those targets be? (any except self)
- targetCount (int) = 0 // How many targets should get ammo? (random, any, nearest)

OPTIONAL
- options (Effect[]) // What different options can we choose from?

MULTI
- effects (Effect[]) // What effects should we apply? (used for OPTIONAL)

DOOR
- targetCount (int) // How many doors will be targeted?
- action (DoorActionType) // What action are we doing to the door(s)?
- target (EffectTarget) // Which doors will be targeted?
- where (EffectLocation) = any // Where must those doors be? (any except self)
